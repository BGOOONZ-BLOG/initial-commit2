**Advice to the New Programmers.üèÅ**

* Don't think that you are not enough to compete.

> * **No one has 100% clarity about everything.**
> * **Every one is zero at the time of starting.**
> * **Never stop learning.**
> * **Start slow and Strong.**
> * **Never Ever think Coding is for Clevers.**
> * **Make Mistakes and Learn from your mistakes.**
> * **Don't Learn Coding for the sake of Job**

Additionally:

> * Be aware that the only constant in the tech¬†*(& programming)*¬†world is change: be open to it, accept it, and don't look at it as some serious inconvenience to be fought!
> * Take pride in what you build, but be ready to have it replaced by someone or even yourself. Don't attach ego to your code.
> * When you're stuck, write your program on paper, then jump into the technical issues of syntax, languages, etc. Eh, it really works, and is almost kind of magic! üòÑ When you don't have to think about syntax (...) you have more brain to solve the actual problem, I guess.
> * Even if you're just getting started, try to not only focus on coding itself but on all the necessary things around writing code, too: domain model, estimation, design collaboration, git flow, pull requests, deployment process, debugging (...). It may be hard, but if you can learn and practice some of them before entering the workforce, you can really hit the ground running!
> * Programming can also one of the most frustrating things you will ever do. Feeling frustrated is completely normal, and will probably never completely go away.¬†*As you get better, you'll just attack harder problems but have the same problem.*¬†Yet, no matter how frustrating your problems are, there is almost certainly a solution out there.

Lastly, just don't give up, and be less afraid. üß°

# 1. Don‚Äôt Sacrifice Readability

Whenever you‚Äôre writing a piece of code, you should think about what the next developer is going to find when looking at that piece of code.

Write that piece of code with the mentality to make it easily understandable and as readable as you can. The ratio of time spent reading code versus writing code is well over 10-to-1. This means that you can save a lot of time in the long run by putting in a little more effort into making your code readable.

In order to write readable code try to keep it as simple as possible. There‚Äôs no need to be fancy when it comes to writing code ‚Äî write simple code that everyone can understand.

# 2. Focus On The Business

Some developers are only interested in the technical aspects of their job. They don‚Äôt care about the business or the economic factors that justify their job‚Äôs existence.

Other developers tend to be so focused on learning the tech stack that the business gets out of sight. Of course, it‚Äôs great that you‚Äôre trying to master your tech stack but it‚Äôs important to keep the business in mind.¬†*Why*¬†are you building this?

Is what you‚Äôre working on creating value for the business or are you spending too much time on something that doesn‚Äôt really matter? It‚Äôs an important question that you should keep asking yourself.

# 3. Don‚Äôt Dive Straight Into the Code

Rushing into the code might seem exciting at first. However, that excitement might end up costing you a lot of time. When jumping straight into the coding part, you‚Äôll eventually lose sight of the bigger picture.

You need to plan and organize before you start coding. Think about problems that you might find along the way and how can you tackle them. How will you structure your code? What‚Äôs the reason that you‚Äôre going to implement this feature?

These are all great questions to ask yourself before you start coding. These questions can make you more aware of the fact that there‚Äôs a lot to think about before writing code.

# 4. Work On a Side Project

Practicing and expanding your knowledge while working on something fun is something that every developer should do. The best way to learn is still by getting your hands dirty.

I‚Äôve written a couple of articles that contain a list of fun side projects that you could work on. These are great to expand your knowledge and get some hands-on experience with a tech stack of your choice.

# 5. Pick the Right Tools

Using the right tools can save you a lot of time in the long run, so you better spend some time playing around with all sorts of tools and find out what‚Äôs working best for you.

The tools that you use have a big impact on your productivity, so choose wisely.

# 6. Become an Expert at Debugging

Any change to code can be disruptive. And as a software engineer whose job it is to write code, you can probably see that these things don‚Äôt always go well together. It‚Äôs inevitable that bugs sneak into the codebase at some point in time.

The average software engineer spends a great amount of time on debugging, which means it‚Äôs a great skill to master. Especially because debugging can really turn into a time-consuming process if you don‚Äôt know how to do it properly.

What debugging really comes down to is the art of problem-solving. For the majority of software engineers, a large part of their work is going to be fixing small bugs. Many of these bugs can be obscure and hard to track.

Being able to quickly identify where a bug might be in the code is a powerful skill. The better your analytical and problem-solving skills, the more accurately and precisely you can solve these bugs.

# 7. Make mistakes

Making mistakes is how we learn. Don‚Äôt be afraid to make mistakes. Even the most seasoned developer has made these mistakes ‚Äî and learned from them.

Making mistakes is what makes us human. It‚Äôs something that shouldn‚Äôt bother you too much since it has happened to every developer more often than not. And it still happens to all of us on a daily basis.

Software development is hard and thus mistakes happen all the time. One mistake having more impact than others, but mistakes are made all the time. The thing with making mistakes is that it‚Äôs totally fine. In fact, mistakes are what make us grow.

You can take advantage of the mistakes in this list and learn from them so that you can become a better developer. As Eleanor Roosevelt once said: learn from the mistakes of others. You can‚Äôt live long enough to make them all yourself.

# 8. Learn New Things

As Isaac Asimov said, ‚ÄúThe day you stop learning is the day you begin decaying.‚Äù This is especially true in the tech world, where things change at a rapid pace.

It‚Äôs impossible to keep up with everything that changes, and even if you could, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it. Don‚Äôt take this to the extreme, but it‚Äôs good to learn a new framework or programming language every once in a while.

This doesn‚Äôt mean that you have to become an expert in all of these programming languages or frameworks. It‚Äôs good to experiment with some of them and see whether you like them.

You‚Äôll gain a lot of new insights into how certain problems are solved in other programming languages or frameworks that will help you grow as a programmer.

# 9. Minimize Distractions

Social media is a big distraction. And for some reason, we tend to check it every 10 minutes to see if we‚Äôre not missing out on something. This absolutely kills your ‚Äúflow‚Äù and your productivity will go to zero.

If you want to get things done, shut down all notifications and don‚Äôt look at your phone. Zero interruptions will give you extreme focus, which leads to big results.

Seriously, you should give this a try.

# 10. Don‚Äôt Be Afraid to Ask For Help

Every developer, no matter how experienced, will be stuck every once in a while. When you‚Äôre in a situation like this it‚Äôs important to keep a short feedback loop.

Asking for help doesn‚Äôt mean that you‚Äôre incompetent. People think you‚Äôre incompetent if you‚Äôre staring at your screen struggling with the same problem for hours.

Before you ask for help, make sure you‚Äôve checked all the things that you know of. Disturbing other developers unnecessarily is not what you want to accomplish.

More often than not some other developer can give you a push in the right direction. This way you save yourself a lot of time because you can start working on your task again instead of figuring it out all by yourself.

Like J.K. Rowling said: help only comes to those who ask for it.

# 11. Know When To Walk Away From Your Computer

Most programmers tend to get so fed up with coding. Some of us spend hours on the computer without taking any breaks. However, a lot of the time this doesn‚Äôt lead to any results.

Although it sounds counterintuitive, taking more breaks will help you get more things done.

Working too long without breaks will eventually make you less productive. You can compare this with going to the gym. If you go to the gym for an hour, you will build muscle. If you train for two hours straight, you get overtrained and it will have the opposite effect.

The same applies to writing code, in my opinion. Clear your head for a few minutes and refresh your focus. Stretch your legs or get something to drink. You will find out that you‚Äôre able to solve problems more quickly.
