<p><strong>Heroku lets you deploy, run and manage applications written in Ruby, Node.js, Java, Python, Clojure, Scala, Go and PHP. An application is a collection of _source code</strong>_** written in one of these languages, perhaps a framework, and some **_<strong>dependency description</strong>_** that instructs a build system as to which additional dependencies are needed in order to build and run the application.**</p>

<p><strong>This is a quick tutorial explaining how to get a static website hosted on Heroku.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Heroku hosts apps on the internet, not static websites. To get it to run your static portfolio, personal blog, etc., you need to trick Heroku into thinking your website is a PHP app.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Basic Assumptions You want to deploy some straight-up HTML, CSS, JS, maybe a few images. Nothing fancy here. You are in the root directory of your site (i.e. the directory that contains all subdirectories and files for the site) The root directory contains a main HTML page, e.g. index.html A Heroku app and remote are set up and ready to go Steps Add a file called composer.json to the root directory by running touch composer.json Add a file called index.php to the root directory by running touch index.php Rename the homepage (e.g. index.html) to home.html In index.php, add the following line: In composer.json, add the following line: {} Run git push heroku master Done! Visit your deployed single-page website, hosted by Heroku (as a fake PHP app ☺).</p>

<h4 id="create-the-project">1.) Create the project <a href="#8451" id="8451"></a></h4>
<p>Starting with any basic boilerplate demo server with NodeJS.</p>
<p>Open a terminal and run the command <code>npm init -y</code> in order to create a new project. The dummy server will be written in <a href="https://expressjs.com">Express</a>, so we need to run the <code>npm install express</code> command to install this module.</p>
<p>Once this library is installed, we can create a new file for our project, named <code>app.js</code>.</p>
<p>We can start the application by running <code>node app.js</code>. Then we can try it out at the following URL <code>http://localhost:3000</code>. At this point you should see the message <code>Hello World</code> in the browser.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*3FuViRnU9-PB5uqf.png" /></p>
<h4 id="version-control">2.) Version Control <a href="#5a4f" id="5a4f"></a></h4>
<p>The next step is to choose a version control system and to place our code in a development platform in a repository.</p>
<p>The most popular version control system is <a href="https://git-scm.com">Git</a> along with <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> as a development platform, so that’s what we’ll use here.</p>
<p>On GitHub, go ahead and create a new repository for your application, like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*pyHPJP0kjAV9sij1.png" /></p>
<p>To upload your local code into a repository, you need to run the commands that are listed on GitHub after you click <code>Create repository</code> button:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*C7nOWV7ygqTRdqcu.png" /></p>
<p><strong>!</strong> Before we do this, we must ignore some files. We want to upload to the repository only the code that we write, without the dependencies (the installed modules).</p>
<p>For that, we need to create a new file <code>.gitignore</code> and inside it write the file that we want to ignore.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*T-9QyGzUdWvFuA-D.png" /></p>
<p>Now, we can write the commands listed in the picture above (the one from GitHub).</p>
<p>If you ran the commands correctly, then it’ll be on your repository’s page. If you refresh it you should see your files, except the one that you explicitly ignored, namely <code>node modules</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*_WzaY9T9A0FsvPgb.png" /></p>
<h4 id="step-3-link-the-repository-with-heroku">Step 3 — Link the repository with Heroku <a href="#f177" id="f177"></a></h4>
<p>At this step, we can link the repository from Github to our Heroku application.</p>
<p>First, create a new application on Heroku and follow the steps listed on the platform.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*J9tMV455odrM00UJ.png" /></p>
<p>Once the application has been created, a window similar to this should appear:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*cowa0t6DgTqjUdjR.png" /></p>
<p>Now, if you look at the navigation at the top, you’ll see <code>Overview</code>, <code>Resources</code>, <code>Deploy</code>, <code>Metrics</code> and so on. Be sure that <code>Deploy</code> is selected. Then on the second row, click on the GitHub icon.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*kAZI5kiisUiZ2Z9D.png" /></p>
<p>Search for the desired application, which is <code>demo-deploy-app-09</code> in our case. Then click <code>Connect</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*T89joca8hXRO8UsL.png" /></p>
<p>Once the application is successfully connected with your Heroku account, you can click <code>Deploy Branch</code> to deploy your application.</p>
<p>If you want, you can also select the option <code>Enable Automatic Deploys</code> which will automatically pull the code from your Github repository every time you make a push to that repository.</p>
<p>Once the application has been deployed, you can click on View to open your application.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*9dBdxScA9_dIEz1Q.png" /></p>
<h4 id="step-4-configure-heroku-to-properly-run-the-application">Step 4 — Configure Heroku to properly run the application <a href="#3096" id="3096"></a></h4>
<p>If you open the application at this point, you should see something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*rMZ8aneIjG3nx211.png" /></p>
<p>That’s right, an error. That’s because Heroku doesn’t know how to start our application.</p>
<p>If you remember, we ran the command <code>node app.js</code> to start the application locally.<br />
Heroku has no way of knowing what commands it needs to run to start the application, and that’s why it threw an error.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, we must create a new file named <code>Procfile</code> with the following content: <code>web: node ./app.js</code>.</p>
<p>To update our application, all we need to do is push a new commit to GitHub. If we have enabled the <code>Automatic Deploys</code> option, then the code will be automatically pulled to Heroku. Otherwise we need to click on <code>Deploy Branch</code> again.</p>
