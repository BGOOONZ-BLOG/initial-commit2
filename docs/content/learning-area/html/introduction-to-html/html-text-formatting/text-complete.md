Quick hummus recipe
===================

This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.

hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.

Ingredients
-----------

-   1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)
-   175g of tahini
-   6 sundried tomatoes
-   Half a red pepper
-   A pinch of cayenne pepper
-   1 clove of garlic
-   A dash of olive oil

Instructions
------------

1.  Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely.
2.  Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely.
3.  Add all the ingredients into a food processor.
4.  Process all the ingredients into a paste.
5.  If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time.
6.  If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time.

For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.

Storage
-------

Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.

hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.
