Tommy the cat
=============

Well I remember it as though it were a meal ago...

Said Tommy the Cat as he reeled back to clear whatever foreign matter may have nestled its way into his mighty throat. Many a fat alley rat had met its demise while staring point blank down the cavernous barrel of this awesome prowling machine. Truly a wonder of nature this urban predator â€” Tommy the cat had many a story to tell. But it was a rare occasion such as this that he did.
