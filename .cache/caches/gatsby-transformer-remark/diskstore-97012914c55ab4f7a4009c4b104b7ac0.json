The DOM tree contains objects representing all the markup's elements, attributes, and text nodes. Browsers then create an accessibility tree based on the DOM tree, which is used by platform-specific Accessibility APIs to provide a representation that can be understood by assistive technologies, such as screen readers.</p>\n<p>There are four things in an accessibility tree object:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>name</strong>  : How can we refer to this thing? For instance, a link with the text \"Read more\" will have \"Read more\" as its name (find more on how names are computed in the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-1.1/\">Accessible Name and Description Computation spec</a>).</li>\n<li><strong>description</strong>  : How do we describe this thing, if we want to provide more description beyond the name? The description of a table could explain what kind of information the table contains.</li>\n<li><strong>role</strong>  : What kind of thing is it? For example, is it a button, a nav bar, or a list of items?</li>\n<li><strong>state</strong>  : Does it have a state? Examples include checked or unchecked for checkboxes, and collapsed or expanded for the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/summary\"><code>&#x3C;summary></code></a> element.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, the accessibility tree often contains information on what can be done with an element: a link can be <em>followed</em>, a text input can be <em>typed into</em>, etc.</p>\n<p>While still in draft form within the Web Incubator Community Group, the <strong><a href=\"https://wicg.github.io/aom/explainer.html\">Accessibility Object Model</a> (AOM)</strong> intends to incubate APIs that make it easier to express accessibility semantics and potentially allow read access to the computed accessibility tree.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<p>  Accessibility\" ARIA\"</p>"}
