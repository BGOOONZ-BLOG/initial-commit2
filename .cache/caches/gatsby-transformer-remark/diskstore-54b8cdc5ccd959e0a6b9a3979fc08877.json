Each of these components is called a <strong>channel</strong>. In a typical image file, the color channels describe how much red, green, and blue are used to make up the final color. To represent a color through which the background can be seen to some extent, a fourth channel is added to the color: the <strong>alpha channel</strong>. The alpha channel specifies how opaque the color is.</h1>\n<p>For example, the color <code>#8921F2</code> (also described as <code>rgb(137, 33, 242)</code> or <code>hsl(270, 89%, 54)</code>) is a nice shade of purple. Below you see a small box of that color in the top-left corner and a box of the <em>same</em> color but with an alpha channel set at 0.5 (50% opacity). The two boxes are drawn on top of a paragraph of text.</p>\n<p><img src=\"alpha-channel-example.png\" alt=\"Image showing the effect of an alpha channel on a color.\"></p>\n<p>As you can see, the color without an alpha channel completely blocks the background text, while the box with the alpha channel leaves it visible through the purple background color.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[interwiki(\"wikipedia\", \"Alpha compositing\"on Wikipedia</li>\n<li>[interwiki(\"wikipedia\", \"RGBA color model\"on Wikipedia</li>\n<li>[interwiki(\"wikipedia\", \"Channel (digital image)\"on Wikipedia</li>\n<li><a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Color\">CSS color</a></li>\n</ul>"}
