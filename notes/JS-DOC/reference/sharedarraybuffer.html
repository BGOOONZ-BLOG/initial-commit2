<h1 id="sharedarraybuffer">SharedArrayBuffer</h1>
<p>The <code>SharedArrayBuffer</code> object is used to represent a generic, fixed-length raw binary data buffer, similar to the <a href="arraybuffer"><code>ArrayBuffer</code></a> object, but in a way that they can be used to create views on shared memory. Unlike an <code>ArrayBuffer</code>, a <code>SharedArrayBuffer</code> cannot become detached.</p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<h3 id="allocating-and-sharing-memory">Allocating and sharing memory</h3>
<p>To share memory using <a href="sharedarraybuffer"><code>SharedArrayBuffer</code></a> objects from one agent in the cluster to another (an agent is either the web page’s main program or one of its web workers), <code>postMessage</code> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm">structured cloning</a> is used.</p>
<p>The structured clone algorithm accepts <code>SharedArrayBuffers</code> and <code>TypedArrays</code> mapped onto <code>SharedArrayBuffers</code>. In both cases, the <code>SharedArrayBuffer</code> object is transmitted to the receiver resulting in a new, private SharedArrayBuffer object in the receiving agent (just as for <a href="arraybuffer"><code>ArrayBuffer</code></a>). However, the shared data block referenced by the two <code>SharedArrayBuffer</code> objects is the same data block, and a side effect to the block in one agent will eventually become visible in the other agent.</p>
<pre><code>var sab = new SharedArrayBuffer(1024);
worker.postMessage(sab);</code></pre>
<h3 id="updating-and-synchronizing-shared-memory-with-atomic-operations">Updating and synchronizing shared memory with atomic operations</h3>
<p>Shared memory can be created and updated simultaneously in workers or the main thread. Depending on the system (the CPU, the OS, the Browser) it can take a while until the change is propagated to all contexts. To synchronize, <a href="atomics">atomic</a> operations are needed.</p>
<h3 id="apis-which-use-sharedarraybuffer-objects">APIs which use SharedArrayBuffer objects</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLRenderingContext/bufferData"><code>WebGLRenderingContext.bufferData()</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLRenderingContext/bufferSubData"><code>WebGLRenderingContext.bufferSubData()</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL2RenderingContext/getBufferSubData"><code>WebGL2RenderingContext.getBufferSubData()</code></a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="security-requirements">Security requirements</h3>
<p>Shared memory and high-resolution timers were effectively <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2018/01/03/mitigations-landing-new-class-timing-attack/">disabled at the start of 2018</a> in light of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability)">Spectre</a>. In 2020, a new, secure approach has been standardized to re-enable shared memory. With a few security measures, <code>postMessage()</code> will no longer throw for <code>SharedArrayBuffer</code> objects and shared memory across threads will be available:</p>
<p>As a baseline requirement, your document needs to be in a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts">secure context</a>.</p>
<p>For top-level documents, two headers will need to be set to cross-origin isolate your site:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy"><code>Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy</code></a> with <code>same-origin</code> as value (protects your origin from attackers)</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy"><code>Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy</code></a> with <code>require-corp</code> as value (protects victims from your origin)</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<pre><code>Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp</code></pre>
<p>To check if cross origin isolation has been successful, you can test against the <code>crossOriginIsolated</code> property available to window and worker contexts:</p>
<pre><code>if (crossOriginIsolated) {
  // Post SharedArrayBuffer
} else {
  // Do something else
}</code></pre>
<p>See also <a href="sharedarraybuffer/planned_changes">Planned changes to shared memory</a> which is starting to roll out to browsers (Firefox 79, for example.)</p>
<h3 id="always-use-the-new-operator-to-create-a-sharedarraybuffer">Always use the new operator to create a SharedArrayBuffer</h3>
<p><code>SharedArrayBuffer</code> constructors are required to be constructed with a <a href="../operators/new"><code>new</code></a> operator. Calling a <code>SharedArrayBuffer</code> constructor as a function without <code>new</code> will throw a <a href="typeerror"><code>TypeError</code></a>.</p>
<pre><code>var sab = SharedArrayBuffer(1024);
// TypeError: calling a builtin SharedArrayBuffer constructor
// without new is forbidden

var sab = new SharedArrayBuffer(1024);</code></pre>
<h2 id="constructor">Constructor</h2>
<p><a href="sharedarraybuffer/sharedarraybuffer"><code>SharedArrayBuffer()</code></a><br />
Creates a new <code>SharedArrayBuffer</code> object.</p>
<h2 id="instance-properties">Instance properties</h2>
<p><a href="sharedarraybuffer/bytelength"><code>SharedArrayBuffer.prototype.byteLength</code></a><br />
The size, in bytes, of the array. This is established when the array is constructed and cannot be changed. <strong>Read only.</strong></p>
<h2 id="instance-methods">Instance methods</h2>
<p><a href="sharedarraybuffer/slice"><code>SharedArrayBuffer.prototype.slice(begin, end)</code></a><br />
Returns a new <code>SharedArrayBuffer</code> whose contents are a copy of this <code>SharedArrayBuffer</code>’s bytes from <code>begin</code>, inclusive, up to <code>end</code>, exclusive. If either <code>begin</code> or <code>end</code> is negative, it refers to an index from the end of the array, as opposed to from the beginning.</p>
