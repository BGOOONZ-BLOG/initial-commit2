This tutorial primarily focuses on JavaScript following the \[ECMAScript 5\]\[es5\] (ES5) specification. \[ES2015\]\[\] (also known as ES6) was released in 2015 and brings many new features to the language, including new syntax constructs.

While this tutorial wonâ€™t go into detail about new features in ES2015 and newer versions, it will point differences to/alternatives for certain ES5 features if they exist.
