<h3 id="graphs">Graphs</h3>
<p><strong>graph</strong>: collections of data represented by nodes and connections between nodes<br />
<strong>graphs</strong>: way to formally represent network; ordered pairs<br />
<strong>graphs</strong>: modeling relations between many items; Facebook friends (you = node; friendship = edge; bidirectional); twitter = unidirectional<br />
<strong>graph theory</strong>: study of graphs<br />
<strong>big O of graphs</strong>: G = V(E)</p>
<p>trees are a type of graph</p>
<p>Components required to make a graph:</p>
<ul>
<li><span id="ca43"><strong>nodes or vertices</strong>: represent objects in a dataset (cities, animals, web pages)</span></li>
<li><span id="a2ee"><strong>edges</strong>: connections between vertices; can be bidirectional</span></li>
<li><span id="fc4a"><strong>weight</strong>: cost to travel across an edge; optional (aka cost)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Useful for:</p>
<ul>
<li><span id="769d">maps</span></li>
<li><span id="19f3">networks of activity</span></li>
<li><span id="93d9">anything you can represent as a network</span></li>
<li><span id="45a1">multi-way relational data</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Types of Graphs:</p>
<ul>
<li><span id="f259"><strong>directed</strong>: can only move in one direction along edges; which direction indicated by arrows</span></li>
<li><span id="1bfb"><strong>undirected</strong>: allows movement in both directions along edges; bidirectional</span></li>
<li><span id="e813"><strong>cyclic</strong>: weighted; edges allow you to revisit at least 1 vertex; example weather</span></li>
<li><span id="52d4"><strong>acyclical</strong>: vertices can only be visited once; example recipe</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Two common ways to represent graphs in code:</p>
<ul>
<li><span id="4380"><strong>adjacency lists</strong>: graph stores list of vertices; for each vertex, it stores list of connected vertices</span></li>
<li><span id="dedc"><strong>adjacency matrices</strong>: two-dimensional array of lists with built-in edge weights; denotes no relationship</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Both have strengths and weaknesses.</p>

<h3 id="questions">Questions</h3>
<h4 id="what-is-a-graph">What is a Graph?</h4>
<p>A Graph is a data structure that models objects and pairwise relationships between them with nodes and edges. For example: Users and friendships, locations and paths between them, parents and children, etc.</p>
<h4 id="why-is-it-important-to-learn-graphs">Why is it important to learn Graphs?</h4>
<p>Graphs represent relationships between data. Anytime you can identify a relationship pattern, you can build a graph and often gain insights through a traversal. These insights can be very powerful, allowing you to find new relationships, like users who have a similar taste in music or purchasing.</p>
<h4 id="how-many-types-of-graphs-are-there">How many types of graphs are there?</h4>
<p>Graphs can be directed or undirected, cyclic or acyclic, weighted or unweighted. They can also be represented with different underlying structures including, but not limited to, adjacency lists, adjacency matrices, object and pointers, or a custom solution.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-the-time-complexity-big-o-to-addremoveget-a-vertexedge-for-a-graph">What is the time complexity (big-O) to add/remove/get a vertex/edge for a graph?</h4>
<p>It depends on the implementation. (<a href="https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Graphs/tree/master/objectives/graph-representations" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">Graph Representations</a>). Before choosing an implementation, it is wise to consider the tradeoffs and complexities of the most commonly used operations.</p>
<h3 id="graph-representations">Graph Representations</h3>
<p>The two most common ways to represent graphs in code are adjacency lists and adjacency matrices, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. When deciding on a graph implementation, it’s important to understand the type of data and operations you will be using.</p>

<h3 id="adjacency-list">Adjacency List</h3>
<p>In an adjacency list, the graph stores a list of vertices and for each vertex, a list of each vertex to which it’s connected. So, for the following graph…</p>
<p>…an adjacency list in Python could look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.vertices = {
                          &quot;A&quot;: {&quot;B&quot;},
                          &quot;B&quot;: {&quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;},
                          &quot;C&quot;: {&quot;E&quot;},
                          &quot;D&quot;: {&quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot;},
                          &quot;E&quot;: {&quot;C&quot;},
                          &quot;F&quot;: {&quot;C&quot;},
                          &quot;G&quot;: {&quot;A&quot;, &quot;F&quot;}
                        }</code></pre>
<p>Note that this adjacency list doesn’t actually use any lists. The <code>vertices</code> collection is a <code>dictionary</code> which lets us access each collection of edges in O(1) constant time while the edges are contained in a <code>set</code> which lets us check for the existence of edges in O(1) constant time.</p>
<h3 id="adjacency-matrix">Adjacency Matrix</h3>
<p>Now, let’s see what this graph might look like as an adjacency matrix:</p>
<pre><code>class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.edges = [[0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
                      [0,0,1,1,0,0,0],
                      [0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
                      [0,0,0,0,0,1,1],
                      [0,0,1,0,0,0,0],
                      [0,0,1,0,0,0,0],
                      [1,0,0,0,0,1,0]]</code></pre>
<p>We represent this matrix as a two-dimensional array, or a list of lists. With this implementation, we get the benefit of built-in edge weights but do not have an association between the values of our vertices and their index.</p>
<p>In practice, both of these would probably contain more information by including Vertex or Edge classes.</p>
<h3 id="tradeoffs">Tradeoffs</h3>
<p>Both adjacency matrices and adjacency lists have their own strengths and weaknesses. Let’s explore their tradeoffs.</p>
<p>For the following:</p>
<pre><code>V: Total number of vertices in the graph
E: Total number of edges in the graph
e: Average number of edges per vertex</code></pre>
<h4 id="space-complexity">Space Complexity</h4>
<ul>
<li><span id="f8f8"><strong>Adjacency Matrix</strong>: O(V ^ 2)</span></li>
<li><span id="1946"><strong>Adjacency List</strong>: O(V + E)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Consider a sparse graph with 100 vertices and only one edge. An adjacency list would have to store all 100 vertices but only needs to keep track of that single edge. The adjacency matrix would need to store 100x100=10,000 possible connections, even though all but one would be 0.</p>
<p>Now consider a dense graph where each vertex points to each other vertex. In this case, the total number of edges will approach V² so the space complexities of each are comparable. However, dictionaries and sets are less space efficient than lists so for dense graphs, the adjacency matrix is more efficient.</p>
<p>Takeaway: Adjacency lists are more space efficient for <strong>sparse</strong> graphs while adjacency matrices become efficient for <strong>dense</strong> graphs.</p>
<h4 id="add-vertex">Add Vertex</h4>
<ul>
<li><span id="6257"><strong>Adjacency Matrix</strong>: O(V)</span></li>
<li><span id="6a8f"><strong>Adjacency List</strong>: O(1)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Adding a vertex is extremely simple in an adjacency list:</p>
<pre><code>self.vertices[&quot;H&quot;] = set()</code></pre>
<p>Adding a new key to a dictionary is a constant-time operation.</p>
<p>For an adjacency matrix, we would need to add a new value to the end of each existing row, then add a new row at the end.</p>
<pre><code>for v in self.edges:
  self.edges[v].append(0)
v.append([0] * len(self.edges + 1))</code></pre>
<p>Remember that with Python lists, appending to the end of a list is usually O(1) due to over-allocation of memory but can be O(n) when the over-allocated memory fills up. When this occurs, adding the vertex can be O(V²).</p>
<p>Takeaway: Adding vertices is very efficient in adjacency lists but very inefficient for adjacency matrices.</p>
<h4 id="remove-vertex">Remove Vertex</h4>
<ul>
<li><span id="8226"><strong>Adjacency Matrix</strong>: O(V ^ 2)</span></li>
<li><span id="85fd"><strong>Adjacency List</strong>: O(V)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Removing vertices is pretty inefficient in both representations. In an adjacency matrix, we need to remove the removed vertex’s row, then remove that column from each other row. Removing an element from a list requires moving everything after that element over by one slot which takes an average of V/2 operations. Since we need to do that for every single row in our matrix, that results in a V² time complexity. On top of that, we need to reduce the index of each vertex after our removed index by 1 as well which doesn’t add to our quadratic time complexity, but does add extra operations.</p>
<p>For an adjacency list, we need to visit each vertex and remove all edges pointing to our removed vertex. Removing elements from sets and dictionaries is a O(1) operation, so this results in an overall O(V) time complexity.</p>
<p>Takeaway: Removing vertices is inefficient in both adjacency matrices and lists but more inefficient in matrices.</p>
<h4 id="add-edge">Add Edge</h4>
<ul>
<li><span id="dbbe"><strong>Adjacency Matrix</strong>: O(1)</span></li>
<li><span id="3968"><strong>Adjacency List</strong>: O(1)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Adding an edge in an adjacency matrix is quite simple:</p>
<pre><code>self.edges[v1][v2] = 1</code></pre>
<p>Adding an edge in an adjacency list is similarly simple:</p>
<pre><code>self.vertices[v1].add(v2)</code></pre>
<p>Both are constant-time operations.</p>
<p>Takeaway: Adding edges to both adjacency lists and matrices is very efficient.</p>
<h4 id="remove-edge">Remove Edge</h4>
<ul>
<li><span id="b417"><strong>Adjacency Matrix</strong>: O(1)</span></li>
<li><span id="d794"><strong>Adjacency List</strong>: O(1)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Removing an edge from an adjacency matrix is quite simple:</p>
<pre><code>self.edges[v1][v2] = 0</code></pre>
<p>Removing an edge from an adjacency list is similarly simple:</p>
<pre><code>self.vertices[v1].remove(v2)</code></pre>
<p>Both are constant-time operations.</p>
<p>Takeaway: Removing edges from both adjacency lists and matrices is very efficient.</p>
<h4 id="find-edge">Find Edge</h4>
<ul>
<li><span id="dc68"><strong>Adjacency Matrix</strong>: O(1)</span></li>
<li><span id="2b87"><strong>Adjacency List</strong>: O(1)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Finding an edge in an adjacency matrix is quite simple:</p>
<pre><code>return self.edges[v1][v2] &gt; 0</code></pre>
<p>Finding an edge in an adjacency list is similarly simple:</p>
<pre><code>return v2 in self.vertices[v1]</code></pre>
<p>Both are constant-time operations.</p>
<p>Takeaway: Finding edges from both adjacency lists and matrices is very efficient.</p>
<h4 id="get-all-edges-from-vertex">Get All Edges from Vertex</h4>
<ul>
<li><span id="798e"><strong>Adjacency Matrix</strong>: O(V)</span></li>
<li><span id="fa79"><strong>Adjacency List</strong>: O(1)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Say you want to know all the edges originating from a particular vertex. With an adjacency list, this is as simple as returning the value from the vertex dictionary:</p>
<pre><code>return self.vertex[v]</code></pre>
<p>In an adjacency matrix, however, it’s a bit more complicated. You would need to iterate through the entire row and populate a list based on the results:</p>
<pre><code>v_edges = []
for v2 in self.edges[v]:
    if self.edges[v][v2] &gt; 0:
        v_edges.append(v2)
return v_edges</code></pre>
<p>Takeaway: Fetching all edges is more efficient in an adjacency list than an adjacency matrix.</p>

<li><span id="0e05">Let’s find the maximum number of edges in a directed graph. If there are |V| nodes in a directed graph (in the example below, six nodes), that means that each node can have up to |v| connections (in the example below, six connections).</span></li>
